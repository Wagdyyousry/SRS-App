## SRS App - service Booking App       ----       *Mandatory Task at the bottom*
A simple "Service reservation system" to connect users with specialists to search, filter, and book appointments with various specialists (doctors, consultants, engineers, etc).

### Setup Instructions
1. "Clone the repo"
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/srs_system.git
   cd srs_system
2. Install dependencies
3. Connect Firebase
  . Create a Firebase project.
  . Add google-services.json to /android/app/.
  . Add GoogleService-Info.plist to /ios/Runner/.
4. Run the App

### App Architecture
This app uses MVVM and GetX for state management.The structure includes:
. Models: Represent core data types like SpecialistModel, BookingModel.
. Controllers: Business logic using GetX (e.g., SpecialistsController, UserController).
. Repositories: Abstract Firebase interactions (SpecialistsRepo).
. Views (UI): Built with Flutter widgets and GetX bindings.
. Firebase: Handles authentication, Firestore database, and storage.

### Known Limitations =>"Future features"
. No real-time chat between user and specialist (future feature).
. No notifications/reminders system.
. Specialist images are not yet uploaded from device/gallery.
. No role-based login (e.g., admin vs. regular user).
. Basic error handling and form validation in some screens.

###ðŸ“Œ Business Requirements Understanding
The app helps users discover and book appointments with verified specialists. It makes it easy to search by name or category and ensures clear visibility into available time slots. The goal is to reduce friction in finding trustworthy experts across different professions and make booking fast, flexible, and remote-friendly.  

### User Experience Thought Process -- A helpful improvement:

1- Showing real-time availability, This would make booking more intuitive and reduce the chance of booking conflicts.
2- Cancelling a reservation takes 5 to 10 minutes before cancellation. In case the user wants to return the booking.
3- Possibility of canceling the reservation for a period of time.
4- Recommend the user to take the necessary precautions for that specialist, depending on similar cases.
5- "Favorites" feature for easy future access. This is useful for users who are browsing now but intend to book later.
6- Instant Chat Before Booking - Allowing users to message a specialist before booking  could reduce 
   hesitation, especially if they have questions about availability or services.
7- Booking Confirmation and Reminders through push notifications.
